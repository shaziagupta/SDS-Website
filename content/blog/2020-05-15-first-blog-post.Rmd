Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON = "/usr/bin/python")
use_python("usr/bin/python")

While taking this class, I learned the basics of using Python, a programming language that can be used to create websites, web applications and general-purpose programming tasks. The language emphasizes the readability of code, and utilizies significant whitespace. Python can also be used via R Studio by using the "reticulate" package.

One of Python's basic built-in functions is to create lists. Using this list function, I can figure out the length of a list. In this example, the length of this list is 3.

```{python}
x=range(2,8,2)
x=list(x)
len(x)
```
Next, I can use the insert function to insert an element at any location on the list. For this example, I'll insert the number 5 in the fourth position. Remember, the positions in R Studio start at zero, not one!

```{python}
list1=[1,2,3,4]
list1.insert(4,5)
list1[4]
list1
```
Now, the number 5 can be seen at the end of the list.

A third easy function to use is the append function, which can add a value to the list. In this example, I'll add the number 6 to the list.
```{python}
list1.append(6)
list1
```

The last basic function for this post is the reverse function, which puts the list in the opposite order. This can be helpful when wanting to find the maximum values in a list. In this example, I'll reverse the list shown above.
```{python}
list1.reverse()
list1
```
Thanks for reading, I'll be posting more blogs as I expand my skillset. Hope this helps!
